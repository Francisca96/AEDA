AEDA-Casino

Within the scope of Algorithms and Data Structures course unit we were challenged to analyse, design, develop and test a problem using Object Oriented Programming and C++ language to implement our solution.

In order do to so, we developed a modular solution for a casino which currently only has the blackjack game, but it was designed to be possible to quickly integrate new games.
